### :hammer: Programming Languages
*Hammers - they put data together and take it apart*  

[Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (Anaconda Distribution)  
* Great for general purpose data tasks, machine learning, and working with big data
  
[R](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (download R first, then RStudio)
* Great for statistical analyses and data visualization; many base functions already built-in
  
[SQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (PostgreSQL)
* Great for all things databases; can be used with Python and R  

---
### :earth_americas: Integrated Development Environments
*Locations - IDEs function differently and you cannot always build anything anywhere*  

[Jupyter Notebooks for Python](https://jupyter.org/)  
* Format is good practice for enterprise-level tools
  
[RStudio for R](https://posit.co/downloads/)
* Can see variables, files, scripts, and data all at once
  
IDLE for Python  
* Included with Python installations, basic
  
R Gui for R  
* Included with R installations, also basic
  
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
* Can be used with many languages
  
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows)  
* Great for Python and code debugging

### :art: Data Manipulation and Visualization
*Saws and paintbrushes - slice 'n' dice your data and paint with it*

### :wrench: Machine Learning
*Wrench set - a variety of sizes for a variety of situations*  

|Algorithms|R|Python|
|---|---|---|
|Linear Regression|
|Logistic Regression|[caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/)|
|Decision Tree|[e1071](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/e1071.pdf)|[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)|
|Random Forest|[randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf)|[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)|
|K-Means|[rpart](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/rpart.pdf)|
|K-Nearest Neighbors|
|Naive Bayes|
* Deep learning practice should come at the end of mastering the basics.

### :warning: Safety First!
Coding projects that impact others and/or use sensitive data should always be reviewed by others. Find other data practitioners you can turn to for help.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Go construct your toolkit!
Everyone's Data Science Toolkit will look a bit different and that is expected. It will also change over time as you learn more.
